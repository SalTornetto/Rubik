# RubikCapstone

Note: The file directory is not perfect as it was merged incorectly between by desktop and laptop. Nevertheless the main files for this project are present in the Rubik/RubikV1/Rubik/Workplace/ directory. 

Welcome to the Rubik's Cube AI Solver! This project explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve a Rubik's Cube in a more intuitive way, focusing on reinforcement learning and 3D graphics. 

This project aims to create an AI that can "think" its way through a Rubik's Cube puzzle instead of following traditional algorithmic approaches. Using PyTorch for neural network development and reinforcement learning, the AI predicts optimal moves to solve the cube. OpenGL and PyGame provide a visual representation of the cube and facilitate animation.

This Project was created to meet the criteria of Kean University's CPS 4951 Senior Capstone course.
